This genus originated in Mesoamerica and was brought to the Caribbean Islands by the Carib natives. Passiflora antioquiensis, the red banana passionfruit, is a species in the Passifloraceae family. Heating around the apical shoots did not appear to induce significant changes in conduit dimension along the rest of the stem. Its stem is erect, branched, and 4–30 in (10–76 cm) high. The chlorosis is mainly attributed to a jasmonic acid (JA)-isoleucine analogue, coronatine (COR), produced by Pst DC3000. Africa, Latin America, and various oceanic islands. However, recent DNA - based phylogenetic studies support recognition of Mahonia, though after the removal of several species into the newly - described genera Alloberberis (formerly Mahonia section Horridae) and Moranothamnus (formerly Mahonia claireae).
