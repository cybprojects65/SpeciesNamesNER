HEATH*    Shannon  M.  HEDTKE*    David M. HILLIS*, **(Section of Integrative Biology and Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, One University Station C0930,   The University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712, USA) Abstract    Appropriate  and  extensive  taxon  sampling  is  one  of  the  most  important  determinants  of  accurate  phylogenetic estimation. In addition, accuracy of inferences about evolutionary processes obtained from phyloge-netic  analyses  is  improved  significantly  by  thorough  taxon  sampling  efforts.  Many  recent  efforts  to  improve  phylogenetic estimates have focused instead on increasing sequence length or the number of overall characters in the  analysis,  and  this  often  does  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  the  accuracy  of  phylogenetic  analyses.  However,  phylogenetic analyses of few taxa (but each represented by many characters) can be subject to strong systematic biases, which in turn produce high measures of repeatability (such as bootstrap proportions) in support of incor-rect or misleading phylogenetic results. Thus, it is important for phylogeneticists to consider both the sampling of taxa,  as  well  as  the  sampling  of  characters,  in  designing  phylogenetic  studies.  Taxon  sampling  also  improves  estimates of evolutionary parameters derived from phylogenetic trees, and is thus important for improved applica-tions  of  phylogenetic  analyses.  Analysis  of  sensitivity  to  taxon  inclusion,  the  possible  effects  of  long-branch  attraction,  and  sensitivity  of  parameter  estimation  for  model-based  methods  should  be  a  part  of  any  careful  and  thorough  phylogenetic  analysis.  Furthermore,  recent  improvements  in  phylogenetic  algorithms  and  in  computa-tional  power  have  removed  many  constraints  on  analyzing  large,  thoroughly  sampled  data  sets.  Thorough  taxon  sampling is thus one of the most practical ways to improve the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates, as well as the accuracy of biological inferences that are based on these phylogenetic trees. Key words   consistency, long-branch attraction, phylogenetic accuracy, phylogenomics, systematic error, taxon sampling, Tree of Life.The past two decades have seen great progress in reconstructing  the  Tree  of  Life.  The  endeavor  of  inferring  the  relationships  among  all  living  things  is  not only of intrinsic interest to biologists, but also has many    practical    applications    throughout    biology.    Phylogenetic  trees  allow  biologists  to  make  predic-tions  about  biology,  because  we  can  infer  when  and  where various structures, molecules, or behaviors have evolved   in   living   organisms.   Trees   also   provide   information  about  the  expected  distribution  of  these  features  across  taxonomic  groups.  Moreover,  phylog-enies   facilitate   the   interpretation   of   comparative   observations    by    accounting    for    the    historical    non-independence    of    organisms    when    analyzing    across  various  levels  of  biological  organization  (e.g.,  genes,  genomes,  individuals,  populations,  species,  or  clades).    The  number  of  practical  applications  of  phy-logenetics  continues  to  grow  each  year.  For  example,  phylogenetics  has  become  crucial  for  comparing  and  interpreting  the  various  genome  sequencing  projects.  The  very  reason  that  many  such  projects  are  under-taken  is  to  provide  a  broad  evolutionary  spectrum  for  interpretation of genome function and evolution in the framework of the Tree of Life (Eisen, 1998). Without a  phylogenetic  framework,  every  genome  would  be  a  new  independent  mystery,  and  the  detection  of  gene  function  would  be  greatly  hindered  without  compara-tive  analyses.  In  the  absence  of  phylogenetic  com-parisons,  studying  many  gene  functions  in  the  human  genome would require experimentation and manipula-tion  that  is  not  practical  or  ethical  in  humans.  There-fore, in a very real sense, the Tree of Life helps us to understand  how  humans  function  and  how  we  differ  from one another and from other species. The same is also  true  of  all  the  organisms  that  we  eat,  of  all  the  organisms that make us sick, of all the organisms that maintain our ecosystems, and of all the organisms that make  the  biological  world  interesting,  entertaining,  and beautiful.   Applications  of  phylogenetics  are  by  no  means  limited  to  the  functional  and  structural  study  of  ge-nomes, however. Phylogenetic applications span much of biology, from human health (Bush et al., 1999) and forensics (Hillis & Huelsenbeck, 1994; Metzker et al., 2002)  to  conservation  biology  (Crandall  et  al.,  2000)  ———————————Received: 2 February 2008    Accepted: 23 April 2008 * All authors contributed equally to this work. ** E-mail: dhillis@mail.utexas.edu; phone: 512-471-5792. 
Journal  of  Systematics  and  Evolution    Vol.  46    No.  3    2008  240 and  studies  of  behavior  (Martins,  1996).  Many  of  these    applications    require    accurate    phylogenetic    estimates, not only in terms of tree topologies, but also in  branch  lengths  (for  estimation  of  time  and/or  the  amount   of   change),   ancestral   character   states   (for   estimation of evolutionary transitions), and parameters of  evolutionary  models  (for  study  of  evolutionary  processes).  In  general,  accurate  molecular  phyloge-netic estimates (estimates that represent true historical relationships  among  species)  are  dependent  on  four  primary  factors  (Swofford  et  al.,  1996):  (1)  appropri-ate selection of target genes for analysis; (2) collection of  enough  sequence  data  to  obtain  a  robust  and  re-peatable   estimate;   (3)   use   of   accurate   analytical   methods;  and  (4)  sufficient  taxon  sampling  for  the  problem  of  interest.  The  first  three  of  these  factors  often receive the greatest attention from investigators, but  increased  taxon  sampling  can  be  one  of  the  most  practical   and   feasible   approaches   for   improving   phylogenetic  estimates  (Zwickl  &  Hillis,  2002).  Here  we  explore  and  review  the  effects  of  taxon  sampling  on phylogenetic analyses and their applications. 1Dense  taxon  sampling  improves  phyloge-netic accuracy Phylogeneticists  have  long  acknowledged  that  data  sets  containing  a  large  number  of  taxa  create  a  more  complex  computational  problem  for  phyloge-netic  analysis.  As  more  taxa  are  added  to  a  phyloge-netic  data  set,  the  number  of  possible  tree  topologies  increases  very  rapidly.  In  addition,  the  degree  of  homoplasy   (convergent   changes   or   reversals)   in-creases   with   the   number   of   taxa   (Sanderson   &   Donoghue,  1989).  Regardless,  numerous  studies  on  the  importance  of  dense  taxon  sampling  have  indi-cated  that  introducing  additional  taxa  into  a  phyloge-netic  analysis  results  (on  average)  in  more  accurate  estimates  of  evolutionary  relationships  (Lecointre  et  al.,  1993;  Philippe  &  Douzery,  1994;  Hillis,  1996,  1998; Graybeal, 1998; Rannala et al., 1998; Zwickl & Hillis,  2002;  Pollock  et  al.,  2002;  Poe,  1998a,  2003;  DeBry,  2005;  Hedtke  et  al.,  2006).  These  studies  represent   a   broad   range   of   approaches   including   simulations,  examinations  of  well-studied  biological  groups, and comparisons to known phylogenies. Each of   these   approaches   has   distinct   advantages   and   disadvantages (Hillis, 1995) and together they provide a strong and consistent message about the importance of dense taxon sampling. The benefits of denser taxon sampling  are  especially  evident  in  conjunction  with  more  thorough  searches  of  solution  space  (Fig.  1).  Additionally,   evaluations   of   phylogenetic   analyses   often  attribute  problematic  reconstruction  and  low  resolution to inadequate taxon sampling (e.g., Bremer et al., 1999; Johnson, 2001; Lin et al., 2002; Braun & Kimball,  2002;  Chen  et  al.,  2003;  Freudenstein  et  al.,  2003; Sorenson et al., 2003; Albrecht et al., 2007). Although  the  importance  of  taxonomic  sampling  has  been  intensely  investigated,  many  studies  have  focused primarily on parsimony and distance methods. Felsenstein  (1978)  demonstrated  that  under  certain  circumstances,  parsimony  methods  are  inconsistent,  meaning  they  converge  on  an  incorrect  topology  as  more  and  more  characters  are  added  for  a  limited  sample  of  taxa.  When  two  non-adjacent  taxa  share  many  homoplastic  character  states  along  long  branches,  parsimony  methods  often  interpret  such  similarity  as  homology.  The  resulting  tree  depicts  the  two taxa as sister to one another, attributing the shared changes to a branch joining them; this effect is termed long-branch  attraction  (LBA).  Inconsistency  is  not  restricted  to  parsimony,  however,  as  all  phylogenetic  reconstruction  methods  can  exhibit  this  behavior  if  their assumptions are seriously violated or if there are not enough taxa in the analysis to accurately estimate the parameters of the evolutionary model (Felsenstein, 1978;  Hendy  &  Penny,  1989;  DeBry,  1992;  Huelsen-beck & Hillis, 1993; Yang, 1994; Huelsenbeck, 1995; Fig.  1.     Error  in  phylogenetic  reconstruction  typically  decreases  with  increased taxon sampling of a given taxonomic group.    The benefits of increased taxon sampling are particularly evident when searches of the solution  space  are  more  thorough.  In  this  graph  (adapted  from  Zwickl  &  Hillis,  2002,  fig.  6),  phylogenetic  error  decreases  with  increased  taxon  sampling  across  all  analyses.  However,  the  benefits  of  adding  additional taxa are smaller if only the stepwise-addition algorithm (SA) is used to find an approximate solution, compared to the more thorough searches    provided    by    stepwise-addition    plus    nearest-neighbor-                interchanges branch-swapping (SA+NNI) or tree bisection-reconnection branch-swapping  (SA+TBR).  Analyses  of  larger  data  sets  generally  require more thorough search algorithms (and thus more computational effort), but result in greatly decreased phylogenetic error. 
HEATH et al.: Taxon sampling and the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses 241Lockhart  et  al.,  1996;  Gascuel  et  al.,  2001;  Huelsen-beck  &  Lander,  2003;  Susko  et  al.,  2004;  Philippe  et  al.,  2005).  For  example,  maximum  likelihood  estima-tion has been shown to be inconsistent in the presence of  severe  branch-length  heterogeneity  (heterotachy,  a  form  of  non-stationarity)  if  the  substitution  process  is  assumed   to   be   homogeneous   across   all   lineages   (Kolaczkowski  &  Thornton,  2004;  Spencer  et  al.,  2005; Philippe et al., 2005). This example emphasizes the  need  for  probabilistic  models  that  incorporate  complex  evolutionary  processes  (Yang  &  Roberts,  1995;  Galtier  &  Gouy;  1998;  Foster,  2004;  Blanquart  &  Lartillot,  2006;  Gowri-Shankar  &  Rattray,  2007;  Blanquart  &  Lartillot,  2008;  Kolaczkowski  &  Thorn-ton, 2008).   Including   additional   taxa   in   a   phylogenetic   analysis  will  increase  the  accuracy  of  the  inferred  topology by dispersing homoplasy across the tree and reducing  the  effect  of  long-branch  attraction.  Hillis  (1996)  analyzed  data  simulated  on  a  228-taxon  tree  and   showed   that   simple   parsimony   and   distance   methods accurately reconstruct the true topology when provided  with  sequences  5,000  nucleotides  in  length.  At  the  time,  this  result  was  surprising  because  it  seemingly  contradicted  the  common  belief  that  accu-rate  phylogenetic  reconstruction  from  very  large  data  sets was infeasible. Moreover, Hillis et al. (1994b) had previously  shown  that  analyses  of  much  smaller  data  sets,  containing  only  4  taxa,  required  considerably  longer sequences to attain the same level of accuracy. The  results  of  Hillis’s  (1996)  large-scale  simulation  indicated  that  for  phylogenies  containing  many  taxa,  convergent  substitutions  or  reversals  (homoplasy)  are  distributed  among  the  many  lineages  in  the  tree  and  therefore such misleading information is less likely to overwhelm the true phylogenetic signal.   Because  inadequate  species  sampling  can  result  in  trees  containing  relatively  long  terminal  branches,  sparsely  sampled  data  sets  are  more  likely  to  be  affected  by  LBA.  Rannala  et  al.  (1998)  simulated  ultrametric trees under a simple model of cladogenesis to investigate the impact of removing ingroup taxa on the  distribution  of  branch  lengths.  They  demonstrated  that decreasing the proportion of sampled taxa leads to an increase in the average length of terminal branches and  generates  tree  shapes  that  may  be  susceptible  to  long-branch   attraction   (Fig.   2).   Huelsenbeck   and   Lander   (2003)   simulated   sequences   using   simple   evolutionary models and determined that the probabil-ity  that  parsimony  is  inconsistent  becomes  greater  as  the proportion of taxa sampled decreases and substitu-tion rates increase. Even under very simple models of evolution,  unweighted  parsimony  underestimated  the  number  of  changes  along  branches  and  converged  on  an incorrect topology (Huelsenbeck & Lander, 2003).   In general, many studies have shown that adding taxa to bisect long branches can mitigate the effect of LBA  (Hendy  &  Penny,  1989;  Graybeal,  1998;  Poe  &  Swofford, 1999; Poe, 2003). However, taxon addition should  be  practiced  judiciously  to  ensure  that  enough  taxa  are  added  to  sufficiently  partition  multiple  long  branches  (Graybeal,  1998;  Poe,  2003)  and  that  the  new  taxa  do  not  introduce  additional  long  branches  (Kim,  1998).  Prudent  taxon  addition  is  particularly  Fig. 2.   Two simulations of a birth-death process to model cladogenesis.    The speciation rate (λ) and extinction rate (μ) were fixed throughout the simulation  and  arbitrarily  set  to  λ /μ=2.

When  taxon  sampling  is  low,  terminal  branch  lengths  are  longer,  indicating  that  sparsely  sampled data sets are susceptible to the effects of long-branch attraction.

Journal  of  Systematics  and  Evolution    Vol.  46    No.  3    2008  242 important  when  conducting  parsimony  analyses  since  this method is especially liable to inconsistency due to long-branch  attraction.  Because  parametric  methods,  such  as  maximum  likelihood,  incorporate  models  that  account  for  unobserved  substitutions,  these  methods  are less prone to the effects of long-branch attraction, as  long  as  the  models  of  evolution  are  adequate.  However, enough taxa must be sampled to parameter-ize  these  models  effectively  (Pollock  et  al.,  2002).  In  addition,   longer   branches   require   more   accurate   models   of   evolution   (because   more   unobserved   changes  must  be  inferred),  so  increased  taxon  sam-pling (which breaks up long branches) greatly benefits parametric  methods  as  well  as  nonparametric  meth-ods.  We  discuss  methods  for  detecting  and  minimiz-ing LBA more completely below. Apart from its effect on topological accuracy, the density  of  taxon  sampling  also  has  an  impact  on  branch-length   estimation.   Branch   lengths   provide   important  information  about  the  amount  of  change  that  has  occurred  over  the  tree  and  are  critical  for  applications  using  phylogenies  to  make  inferences  about   evolution.   Under   the   parsimony   criterion,   branch  lengths  are  often  underestimated  in  sparsely  sampled regions of the tree because less information is available  to  infer  the  history  of  unobserved  substitu-tions  (Fitch  &  Bruschi,  1987;  Fitch  &  Beintema,  1990).  This  artifact  has  been  termed  the  node-density  effect (NDE) and may mislead studies that investigate correlations between rates of molecular evolution and biodiversity  (Webster  et  al.,  2003;  Venditti  et  al.,  2006;  Hugall  &  Lee,  2007).  Maximum  likelihood,  Bayesian, and distance methods are also susceptible to node-density  effects,  particularly  when  the  assumed  model  of  sequence  evolution  is  overly  simple  and  substitution  rates  are  high  (Gojobori  et  al.,  1982;  Bruno  &  Halpern,  1999;  Hugall  &  Lee,  2007).  If  the  density  of  taxon  sampling  is  increased,  additional  internal nodes can reveal undetected substitutions and improve estimates of branch lengths.   It  has  been  shown  that  mis-estimation  of  branch  lengths  can,  in  turn,  lead  to  biased  tree  topologies  (Xia,  2006).  Errors  in  estimates  of  genetic  distance  become  greater  as  the  amount  of  divergence  between  two  sequences  increases.  Pairwise  distance  methods  for   phylogenetic   reconstruction   typically   use   log-   transformed   formulae   to   account   for   unobserved   substitutions  (Swofford  et  al.,  1996;  Hoyle  &  Higgs,  2003).   When   using   log-transformed   formulae   to   calculate  genetic  distances,  particularly  at  high  levels  of  sequence  divergence,  there  is  a  significant  prob-ability  that  the  distance  estimates  will  be  undefined  even  if  the  “true”  model  of  sequence  evolution  is  assumed  (Hoyle  &  Higgs,  2003).  Therefore,  when  conducting  distance-based  analyses,  it  is  very  impor-tant  to  consider  how  taxa  are  sampled  and  avoid  inclusion of highly divergent sequences. 1.1    Increased  taxon  sampling  versus  increased  sequence length Increasing  the  total  number  of  characters  in  a  data  set  can  increase  resolution  and  support  for  a  phylogeny   (Hillis   et   al.,   1994a;   Graybeal,   1994;   Rannala et al., 1998). In particular, increasing charac-ter data such as the number of genes (or total number of   nucleotides)   should   reduce   stochastic   error   or   character  sampling  bias  (Phillips  et  al.,  2004;  Delsuc  et  al.,  2005).  The  rapidly  increasing  amount  of  se-quence   data   available   to   researchers   from   whole   genomes,  expressed  sequence  tags  or  cDNA  libraries,  and  individual  gene-based  studies  means  that  many  analyses of these character-rich phylogenetic matrices can greatly reduce stochastic error. This  plethora  of  sequence  data  has  caused  some  researchers  to  argue  that  large  character  data  sets  alone are sufficient to estimate an accurate phylogeny, notwithstanding the conclusions reached by numerous studies  showing  the  importance  of  taxon  sampling.  For example, Rosenberg and Kumar (2001) conducted a  simulation  study  indicating  that  adding  taxa  to  a  problematic  phylogeny  is  less  effective  than  adding  additional characters. This paper led to a debate in the literature and reanalyses of the Rosenberg and Kumar (2001)  data  (Zwickl  &  Hillis,  2002;  Pollock  et  al.,  2002; Rosenberg & Kumar, 2003; Hillis et al., 2003). Pollock  et  al.  (2002)  reanalyzed  the  Rosenberg  and  Kumar  (2001)  data  using  a  different  approach  to  summarizing   results   (measurement   of   error),   and   Zwickl  and  Hillis  (2002)  re-conducted  the  Rosenberg  and  Kumar  (2001)  study  with  a  different  approach  to  study design that examined a fuller spectrum of taxon sampling strategies. Both studies concluded that taxon sampling  has  a  very  strong  and  positive  effect  on  the  accuracy  of  phylogenetic  reconstruction,  and  showed  in many cases that increasing the number of taxa had a much  greater  beneficial  effect  than  increasing  the  number   of   characters.   However,   because   of   the   ever-increasing availability and generation of genomic data  and  the  difficulty  of  obtaining  sequence  data  for  many taxa, the debate about the relative importance of taxon sampling versus character sampling continues in the literature (Hillis et al., 2003; Rosenberg & Kumar, 2003;  Rokas  et  al.,  2003;  Cummings  &  Meyer,  2005;  Rokas  et  al.,  2005;  Hedtke  et  al.,  2006;  Gatesy  et  al.,  2007).    
HEATH et al.: Taxon sampling and the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses 243More  recently,  Rokas  et  al.  (2003)  argued  that,  under  parsimony,  an  accurate  phylogeny  for  seven  yeast   taxa   could   be   obtained   using   twenty   genes   randomly selected from a data set of 106, regardless of taxonomic  sampling.  The  authors  based  this  claim  on  the bootstrap support for each node in their tree: once twenty  genes  were  sampled,  the  bootstrap  support  for  each  node  rose  above  95%,  and  the  topology  was  identical  to  that  of  the  data  set  using  all  106  genes.  Therefore, they concluded, accuracy was increased by increasing  the  number  of  genes,  with  the  implication  that   many   phylogenetic   studies   may   be   using   an   insufficient number of genes to accurately reconstruct topologies.   The   most   obvious   problem   with   their   study  design  was  that  the  authors  equated  high  boot-strap support with accuracy (rather than more properly with  repeatability).  Analyzing  many  characters  may  result  in  convergence  on  a  single  answer,  but  small  systematic  biases  can  result  in  convergence  on  the  incorrect  answer  (a  point  we  explore  in  the  next  section). 1.2      Increased  character  data  can  reduce  stochas-tic error, but can contribute to systematic error Increasing  the  number  of  nucleotides  will  not  solve  inaccurate  reconstruction  due  to  method  incon-sistency,  or  systematic  error.  All  phylogenetic  meth-ods to date have conditions in which they will perform inconsistently.  Phylogenomic  data  sets,  which  tend  to  have  large  numbers  of  characters  with  relatively  few,  widely  dispersed  taxa,  may  be  particularly  prone  to  problems  with  long-branch  attraction.  LBA  has  been  identified    as    causing    spurious    relationships    in    large-scale   studies   of   several   taxonomic   groups,   including   mammals   (Lin   et   al.,   2002),   metazoans   (Anderson  &  Swofford,  2004;  Baurain  et  al.,  2007),  arthropods   (Delsuc   et   al.,   2003)   and   angiosperms   (Stefanovic et al., 2004). When methods are inconsis-tent,  increasing  character  data  can  increase  statistical  support  for  an  inaccurate  phylogeny  (Huelsenbeck  &  Hillis, 1993). This occurs because measures of support such  as  the  nonparametric  bootstrap  proportion  or  Bayesian posterior probabilities are conditional on the data and the method (Delsuc et al., 2005).   A reanalysis of the Rokas et al. (2003) data set by Hedtke et al. (2006) showed that much of the conflict between  genes  under  parsimony  is  due  to  LBA.  The  taxa sampled are unevenly dispersed across the tree of yeast, and a long branch leading to the outgroup has a tendency  to  pull  particular  taxa  together  across  many  independent  genes.  Hedtke  et  al.  (2006)  additionally  used  genes  simulated  on  a  more  densely  sampled  yeast   phylogeny   to   demonstrate   that   for   a   given   bipartition  affected  by  long-branch  attraction,  boot-strap  support  for  the  wrong  reconstruction  increased  as genes were added to the analysis (Fig. 3). However, when taxon sampling was increased, fewer genes were needed to get acceptable support for the correct bipar-tition. Although Hedtke et al. (2006) did not examine increases in support or accuracy across the entire tree, their  results  are  consistent  with  the  general  finding  that   increased   taxon   sampling   improves   accuracy   across the tree. This discussion so far has assumed that all genes share   the   same   evolutionary   history,   and   that   by   increasing  the  number  of  nucleotides  a  researcher  increases  the  signal  for  that  one  history  —  i.e.,  that  topological  conflicts  between  trees  based  on  single  genes  are  stochastic.  However,  genes  do  not  always  share  an  identical  history,  because  of  horizontal  gene  transfer,  introgression,  incomplete  lineage  sorting,  or  gene  duplication/loss.  In  some  cases,  it  may  be  more  appropriate  to  analyze  genes  separately  rather  than  concatenating  all  the  data  (e.g.,  Ane  &  Sanderson,  2005),  particularly  if  a  researcher  is  interested  in  identifying   processes   that   may   have   affected   the   evolution of a species.   2Strategies for effective taxon sampling   We  have  discussed  how  increased  taxon  sam-pling  can  generally  improve  topological  estimates.  Unfortunately, there is no “magic number” of taxa and genes which ensures the accuracy of a phylogeny. The percentage of taxa sampled within a taxonomic group may  be  more  important  than  the  total  number  of  taxa  (Yang  &  Goldman,  1997;  Hillis,  1998).  For  small  clades   of   closely-related   taxa,   reduced   taxonomic   sampling   may   not   be   problematic   for   phylogeny   reconstruction  (Poe,  1998b).  Critically,  whether  to  increase  sampling  within  a  taxonomic  group  of  inter-est  should  not  depend  on  whether  there  is  statistical  support  for  a  topology,  as  strong  support  does  not  indicate a lack of systematic error. 2.1    Information theory and taxon addition Several  techniques  have  been  developed  from  information  theory  to  examine  where  taxa  could  be  added  to  an  analysis  to  increase  the  precision  of  a  topological  estimate  (Goldman,  1998;  Massingham  &  Goldman,  2000;  Geuten  et  al.,  2007).  The  observed  information  matrix,  which  is  a  measure  of  the  sharp-ness  of  the  curve  about  the  likelihood  function,  is  compared  to  the  expected  (or  Fisher)  information  matrix when a branch is added to different parts of the

As the number of genes in a parsimony analysis increases, the bootstrap for the correct reconstruction of the four-taxon statement decreases, unless taxon sampling is sufficient to break the long branches.

In  essence,  this  com-parison   indicates   the   increase   in   precision   of   the   topology  estimate  that  is  gained  by  adding  a  taxon  along  a  particular  branch  of  the  tree.  Based  on  a  data  set from angiosperms, Geuten et al. (2007) found that information  theory  generally  supports  adding  addi-tional  taxa  close  to  where  the  long  branch  attaches  to  the  rest  of  the  tree,  in  congruence  with  other  studies  based  on  simulation  (Graybeal,  1998;  Poe  &  Swof-ford,  1999).  Unfortunately,  these  techniques,  while  promising,   have   not   been   rigorously   tested,   and   generally assume that one has strong a priori expecta-tions  about  where  additional  taxa  might  fall  on  the  phylogeny.    2.2    Detecting  LBAMost  studies  that  explore  specific  recommenda-tions  for  increased  taxon  sampling  focus  on  detecting  and  correcting  LBA.  LBA  is  often  cited  when  a  topology   fails   to   meet   a   priori   expectations,   but   caution must be applied before attributing unexpected
