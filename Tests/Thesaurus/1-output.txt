The continuous application of traditional [breeding methods] in a given species could lead to thenarrowing of the gene pool from which cultivars are drawn, rendering crops vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses andhampering future progress. Several methods have been devised for introducing exotic variation into elite germplasm withoutundesirable effects. Cases in rice are given to illustrate the potential and limitations of different breeding approaches.KEYWORDS:plant [breeding history], Oryza sativa, crop domestication, genetic improvement, marker-assisted selection■INTRODUCTIONPlant breeding can be considered a coevolutionary processbetween humans and edible plants. People caused changes inthe plants that were used for agriculture and, in turn, those newplant types allowed changes in [human populations] to takeplace. Plants yielding more generous harvests freed some of thepeople’s time for developing art, handcrafting, and science,eventually leading to modern [human life] as we know it.Civilization could not exist without agriculture, and agriculturecould not sustain the civilized world without modern cropvarieties.1From this point of view, it becomes clear that plantbreeding is one of the main foundations of civilization.In industrialized countries, only a small portion of thepopulation is engaged in agriculture. The vast majority ofpeople rely on a tacit social pact for their survival, which assuresthat someone will provide food in exchange for some service orgood. This pact is so basic to modern life that people take forgranted that food is available in the nearest supermarket.However, agriculture failure could cause a disruption of thispact, leaving people in a situation of food insecurity. Thus,protecting agriculture means warranting the foundation pact ofmodern civilization.The core of [plant breeding] is the selection of better typesamong variants, in terms of yield and quality of edible parts;ease of cultivation, harvest, and processing; tolerance toenvironmental stresses; and resistance against pests. Each ofthese aspects of agronomic or food value can be dissected inmany specific traits, each presenting its own range of variation.Manipulating a single trait, disregarding all others, is relativelystraightforward; however, this is unlikely to result in a usefulvariety.The challenge of [plant breeding] resides in improving all ofthe traits of interest simultaneously, a task made more difficultby the genetic correlations between different traits, which maybe due to genes withpleiotropic effects, to physical linkagebetween genes in the chromosomes, or to[population genetics]tructure.2Selecting for one trait will change correlated traits,sometimes in the desired direction, other times in anunfavorable way.3For this reason, selection can lead tounanticipated changes, which are normally within the range thatis normally observed in the crop and thus assumed to pose norisk to consumers or the environment. Whether thisassumption is reasonable or not is a matter of debate.4The objective of this paper is to discuss [plant breeding]methods as an evolving technology, considering the increasinglevels of knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and thecontrol of the process of generating and selecting superior planttypes. In this context, three main eras of [plant breeding] can beidentified: (i) [plant breeding] based on the selection of observedvariants, disregarding their origin; (ii) generation and selectionof expanded variation by controlled mating; and (iii)monitoring the inheritance of within-genome variation andselection of specific recombinants. The fourth stage of plantbreeding, which is not discussed in this paper, can beconsidered the creation and introduction of novel variationSpecial Issue:Safety of GM Crops: Compositional AnalysisReceived:December 28, 2012Revised:March 11, 2013Accepted:March 21, 2013Published:April 3, 2013Reviewpubs.acs.org/JAFC© 2013 American Chemical Society8277dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf305531j|J.

The varietiesresulting from the methods presented in this paper can beconsidered a reference against which transgenic plants arecompared with regard to their food safety.■PLANT BREEDING BASED ON OBSERVEDVARIATIONThe most primitive form of [plant breeding] was the selection ofnaturally occurring variants in the wild and, later, in cultivatedfields. Genetic variation was continuously submitted to the[selection pressure] of food gathering or planting−harvestingcycles. In some cases, this process resulted in deep changes in[plant phenotypes], as exemplified by the derivation of maizefrom teosinte.5This early phase of [plant breeding] spans theperiod from the origin of agriculture until thefirst hybridizationexperiments carried out by Kölreuter in the 1760s.6With thediscovery of the laws of heredity, in the turn from the 19th tothe 20th century, the importance of hybridization in plantbreeding became widely recognized.7Today, almost all plantbreeding programs involve some use of hybridization.8Plant Domestication: The Origin of Crops.For a givengene, mutations are rare events, but considering the largenumbers of plants in afield and of genes in a plant, mutationsare quite frequent events in a population.9Most mutations areunfavorable for survival in the wild, being eliminated from thepopulation in a few generations, as a consequence of naturalselection. However, some of these mutations may result inmore favorable phenotypes either in terms of cultivation or interms of [food quality]. Some of those mutants were rescued byancient farmers, who protected them against competition andestablished with those otherwise disabled plants a relationshipof symbiosis. Unlike wild habitats, cultivatedfields wereenvironments in which those mutations conferred a selectiveadvantage, thus becoming the predominant type through[human selection]. The accumulation of this type of mutationis the major cause of the domestication syndrome, a set ofcharacteristics that made many cultivated species irreversiblydependent on humans for their survival.10The [molecular variability] in domesticated plants tends to besmaller than in related wild species, as a consequence of thefounder effectduring domestication. By strongly selecting for therare mutant plants adapted to cultivation, early farmers droppedmost of the variation present in the wild populations fromwhich cultivated forms arose. It is now clear that many valuablegenes, especially those related to resistance to pests, were leftout of the cultivated gene pool.11Incorporating those genesinto modern cultivars, without losing ground in terms of yieldand product quality, is one of the challenges of modern plantbreeding and one of the most relevant applications of moleculartools in breeding programs.Intuitive Farmer Selection: The Origin of Landraces.Landraces are populations of plants that have been cultivatedfor many generations in a certain region, being shaped by bioticand abiotic stresses, crop management, seed handling, andeating preferences. They are dynamic genetic entities:continuously changing as a consequence of intentional andunintentional selection, seed mixture, and pollen exchange.Landraces are shaped by a balance betweenstabilizing selection,which keeps the identity of the landrace in a given region, andmilddirectional selection, leading to slow adjustments toenvironmental changes. In some cases, quick changes cantake place, especially when the landrace is taken to a differentregion or when new materials are cultivated in close proximitywith the original landrace. Landraces can still nowadays derivefrom modern cultivars, if certified seed production isdiscontinued and farmer-saved seeds are planted recurrently,without care for isolation against seed or pollen contamination.The major characteristics of landraces are12(i) high levels ofgenetic diversity within populations, characterized by a limitedrange of variation between individuals, with distinctive traitsthat make the landrace identifiable; (ii) adaptation to soil andclimate conditions typical of the region, combined withresistance to common pests; (iii) edible parts that are valuedby local people, normally shaping and being shaped by the localcuisine; and (iv) modest but stable yield, conferring foodsecurity to the local community under normal environmentalvariation.Intuitive farmer selection has the virtue of shaping varietiesfor the actual and specific environment of use and for the localfood preferences, serving well the case of subsistenceagriculture, where most of the production is locally consumed.However, when farmers select for one trait, genetic correlationsmay result in undesirable changes in other traits. For example,cereal landraces are normally tall plants, prone to lodging andpresenting lowharvest index, probably as a result of humanselection for large edible parts (panicles, ears, spikes).Nevertheless, for their wealth in genetic variability andadaptability to different environments, landraces are the mostvaluable genetic resources for long-term [plant breeding]programs and also prime targets for germplasm collections.Seed banks around the world keep thousands of samples oflandraces under“ex situ”conservation. In some countries, thereare efforts to devise regulatory mechanisms andfinancialincentives for traditional communities to keep growing theirheritage varieties, aiming for their“in situ”conservation. Newsystems of germplasm conservation have been built on socialnetworks connecting people interested in the subject as ahobby (e.g., seedsavers.org). Those networks take advantage ofmodern [communication tools] to replicate on a global scalewhat used to happen through personal contact in traditionalcommunities.Notwithstanding, a large part of the variability that onceexisted in cultivatedfields of [annual plants] may have beenirreversibly lost during the introduction of modern, high-yielding cultivars. In this sense, the same modern cultivars thatsaved millions from starving may have wiped out varieties thatwere the result of centuries of local intuitive selection byfarmers and a valuable resource for future genetic improvement.Pure Line Selection and Mass Selection: The Origin ofCultivars.The earliest method of [plant breeding] based on anelementary knowledge of the laws of inheritance has been theselection of plants within landraces, based on the assumptionthat the progenies of the best individuals are expected to besuperior to the progeny of a random sample of the population.This method was formally proposed by Louis de Vilmorin in1856, although there are mentions of the use of its principles bysome farmers earlier in the 19th century.13This realization canbe considered as the origin of the paradigm of homogeneitythat dominates breeding, and agriculture as a whole, until today.From this point on, within-field heterogeneity was consideredto be undesirable and both [plant breeding] and agronomydeveloped methods to achieve maximum spatial homogeneity(e.g.,“precision agriculture”).In self-pollinating species, such as rice and wheat, landracescan be thought of as a mixture of pure lines, including someheterozygous individuals derived from a low frequency of cross-Journal of Agricultural and Food ChemistryReviewdx.doi.org/10.1021/jf305531j|J.  Agric.  Food  Chem.2013, 61, 8277−82868278 pollination. In this type of population, selecting single plantsand deriving inbred progenies invariably result in some linesthat outperform the original landrace for a given growingcondition. However, this superiority comes at a cost, becausepure lines are normally less stable than diverse populations inthe face of stresses, especially diseases, and have no capacity forlong-term adaptation, because it is monomorphic for mostgenes.In the case of open-pollinated species, such as maize,landraces are populations of random mating individuals,approximating theHardy−Weinberg equilibrium(HWE), withsome deviations due to mild selection. Mass selection andrecombination of the top-performing portion of the populationresult in a gradual increase in the frequency of favorable alleles.Successive generations of selection on maize landraces resultedin improved open-pollinated varieties, which were the basis ofcorn production until the advent of hybrid maize.■PLANT BREEDING BASED ON CONTROLLEDMATINGDespite the great spontaneous diversity that can be found inthe landraces, simply applying selection on preexisting diversityis an eroding process that eventually comes to a limit. The truecreative power of [plant breeding] resides in promotingrecombination for shuffling favorable alleles.14The combina-tion of different alleles in many loci results in a virtually infinitenumber of genotypes. One could conceivably start acommercial breeding program from a dozen well-adaptedfounding parents, with a clear focus on a specific targetenvironment and evaluating large segregating progenies.Injection of novel variability might become necessary in thecase of a significant change of the target environment, such asthe emergence of new pests for which the founder materialshad no resistance.Given the myriad of possible genotypes resulting fromcrossing diverse parents, the limitation for genetic gainsbecomes the capacity of the breeding program to evaluate alarge number of plants, derived from a large number of crosses.For this reason, [plant breeding] is frequently dubbed a numbersgame, and large competitive programs in commodities investheavily in high-throughput methods for seed handling, planting,evaluating, and harvesting. As genetic gains accumulate, the baris gradually raised, and increasingly higher investments arerequired to keep a steady rate of genetic progress. The limit ofthis escalation is thefinancial viability of returns in the seedmarket and associated business. The main methods developedfor efficient use of resources in breeding programs are discussednext.Pedigree Breeding: Playing with Parents.The vastmajority of the released cultivars of self-pollinating species havebeen developed through the pedigree method. Pedigreebreeding consists of crossing parents and generating segregatingpopulations, which are conducted through generations of self-pollination and selection, until a set of derived lines thatcombines the good characteristics of both parents is obtained.Because it is based on the complementation of traits, thismethod is efficient for breeding for qualitative traits, such asdisease resistance, or easily classifiable traits, such as plantarchitecture or the color or shape of plant parts. The pedigreemethod is appealing to breeders because it allows buildingbetter varieties by putting together, in the same plant, goodcharacteristics that were present in different materials. Becauseall crossings are controlled, it is possible to know the genealogyof each cultivar.The main weakness of the pedigree method resides in thefact that yield is evaluated efficiently only at the end of theprocess, on inbred lines, when seed is available for replicatedtrials. At this point, though, unless a large number of lines havebeen advanced, there is little room for improvement of yieldpotential. Consequently, the rate of progress for yield resultingfrom the pedigree method is normally modest, rarely exceeding1% per year.15Ideotype Breeding: Playing with Traits.The ideotypebreeding approach can be regarded as a strategy to improve thecapacity of the pedigree method to promote gains forquantitative traits, especially yield. It is based on the hypothesisthat one can improve complex traits by changing simpler traitsthat are positively correlated with them.16The advantage of thismethod is that, if the underlying hypothesis proves correct, onecould promote significant gain for yield, even with a smallbreeding program, taking the“smart”approach, as opposed tothe“numbers game”approach of large-scale breeding programs.Additionally, it is scientifically attractive to breeders, becausethey have a chance of changing paradigms in their favorite crop.However, it is important to keep in mind that unfavorablegenetic correlations can offset the advantage brought by thetraits that make up the ideotype.17Changing the ideotype of a crop often requires looking forvariation beyond the boundaries of elite germplasm, which isnormally of the [current plant] type. However, using landraces asparents in breeding programs normally results in markedreduction in yield. For this reason, backcross toward the elitematerials is necessary to recover a competitive progeny.18If thedonor of the new trait is a wild relative, problems of sexualcompatibility,flower sterility, grain quality, or seed dispersal(i.e., grain shattering) may persist for several generations.To avoid undesirable effects of direct introduction of exoticmaterials into elite [breeding populations], those materials arenormally usedfirst in a phase of prebreeding, when breeders tryto break the association between useful and undesirable traits.Once the new trait needed to assemble the ideotype is insertedinto an elite background, those vector lines can be transferredto the elite breeding program.Population Breeding: Playing with Genetic Variance.Although all [breeding methods] imply the application of[selection pressure] on a variable population, the term“[population breeding]”indicates a method designed to improvethe phenotypic performance of an intermating population byincreasing the frequency of favorable alleles controlling traits ofinterest. The simplest version of [population breeding] is the[mass selection] method applied to cross-pollinated species, inwhich the improved population is directly used as a cultivar.Later, more sophisticated schemes of [population breeding] havebeen designed, providing the framework for the development ofthe quantitative [genetics theory]. In modern populationbreeding, the objective is to increase the value of the populationas a source of elite lines. Improving the mean quality of thepopulation, while preserving the variation within it, results intop individuals that outperform previously existing lines. Thoselines can be used as cultivars, in the case of self-pollinatedspecies, or as parents of hybrids, in the case of cross-pollinatedspecies.Population breeding is an open-ended scheme of consecutiverounds of selection and recombination, thus being also knownas recurrent [selection breeding]. Recurrent selection requires anJournal of Agricultural and Food ChemistryReviewdx.doi.org/10.1021/jf305531j|J.  Agric.  Food  Chem.2013, 61, 8277−82868279 efficient crossing system, which can be a limitation for self-pollinating species. This scheme, when applied repeatedly onsmall populations, leads to depletion of genetic variation andslowing of genetic gains.19For this reason, a large effectivepopulation size must be kept throughout or elsegenetic driftwilloverride the other forces acting on the population, hinderinggenetic improvement.20However, even moderate population sizes (e.g., 50 plants)appear to be sufficient to avoid rapid depletion of geneticvariation.21This is probably due to the fact that, whereasselection leads to the loss of diversity in some genes,recombination breaks linkage blocks into smaller pieces,allowing many more combinations of genes than was possiblewith large DNA segments. This phenomenon releases hiddenvariation in latter generations down the process of recurrentselection, compensating for the loss of variation due toselection.22Breeders create new populations by intercrossing severallines, chosen as sources of favorable alleles for one or moretraits. These [synthetic populations] under recurrent selectionmimic the genetic events that used to take place in thelandraces in the hands of traditional farmers, with the differencethat the whole process is monitored and controlled, and[selection pressure] is intensified for faster gains. The rate ofgenetic gain per unit of time can be increased by speeding upthe selection−recombination cycles, by intensifying the[selection pressure], by improving the evaluation precision(thus increasing the heritability), or by any combination ofthose.The general scheme of [population breeding] is veryflexible,allowing customization to specific needs and objectives ofdifferent species and breeding programs. The system can beformatted for rapid, short-term results, normally by applyingstrong [selection pressure] on genetically narrow-based pop-ulations, or for sustained, long-term results, by applyingmoderate [selection pressure] on genetically broad-basedpopulations. Population breeding can also be used as aprebreeding scheme, because its frequent crossing eventspromote recombination between exotic and elite genomes,purging unfavorable exotic genes from the population.Hybrid Breeding: Playing with Heterosis.Heterosis isthe superiority of hybrid individuals compared to inbredindividuals.23Within certain limits, the more divergent are theparents, the higher is the heterosis on their offspring.24,25Hybrid vigor decays rapidly through generations of inbreeding,indicating that, whatever is the mechanism underlying heterosis,it is due to the presence of heterozygous loci. For this reason,maize breeding programs nowadays are focused on developingcompetitiveF1 hybrids, in which heterozygosis is at itsmaximum.Two challenges are present in hybrid breeding programs: (i)the need to improve at least two populations toward agronomicadaptation, while keeping them genetically distant enough toexpress strong heterosis, and (ii) developing efficient seedproduction of selected hybrids, such that the cost of seedproduction does not offset the value of the additional yieldresulting from heterosis. In maize, thefirst problem led to theconcept ofheterotic groups,26splitting the elite gene pool intosubsets, within which [population breeding] is applied. Thesecond problem was solved by the improvement of parentallines, resulting in higher yield in seed productionfields, and bythe use of male [sterility genes] and mechanical emasculation(“detasselling”) to avoid self-pollination.On the other hand, hybrids present great advantages fromthe business perspective. The seeds produced by hybrid plantsare genetically heterogeneous due to the segregation ofthousands of genes. If planted, the resulting crop wouldpresent a large variation in agronomic traits, plant architecture,and cycle duration, thus reducing yield and grain quality.Hence, farmers must buy new seeds every year, resulting in aconstant demand for hybrid seeds. Additionally, with the adventof the transgenics, hybrid seeds became preferential carriers ofthose valuable proprietary traits because they allow a bettercontrol of the event by the owner.■PLANT BREEDING BASED ON MONITOREDRECOMBINATIONTraditional [breeding methods] were based on the complemen-tarity between parental characteristics. However, little ornothing was known about which part of the genome camefrom each parent. This situation changed with the advent anddissemination of molecular marker technologies, which made itpossible to monitor the transmission of chromosome segmentsin the progeny.27Virtually any sequence variation between individuals can beused to design a marker that will allow the identification of theparent that contributed a specific segment of the chromosomein a recombinant line. Until recently, the most popular markerswere the simple sequence repeats (SSRs), also known asmicrosatellites. Those markers were superseded by the singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are more abundantin the genome and more amenable to high-throughputgenotyping.Molecular markers are essential tools for studying the geneticcontrol of any trait of interest, eventually leading to theidentification of the genes underlying the trait and themetabolic chains involved. This venue can be broadly definedas [molecular biology], which dominated thefield of biologicalsciences in the past decades. However, in this paper we limitthe discussion to the application of molecular markers as toolsfor [plant breeding].Mapping Genes of Interest: Finding Needles in theHaystack.When many molecular markers are genotyped in aset of plants derived from a single cross, the frequency ofrecombination between them can be used to infer their orderand relative distance in the chromosomes, resulting in a geneticmap. If those plants, or their progeny, are evaluated for aquantitative trait, a statistical model can be built in which partof the phenotypic variance can be explained by some of themarkers, which implies that those markers should be linked tothe genes underlying the trait. This approach results inquantitative trait loci(QTL) maps, which are normally thefirst step toward understanding the genetic control of aquantitative trait.28From a QTL map, a plant breeder can getan insight into the number of loci controlling a trait, theirrelative importance, and their approximate position in thegenome. In the case of large-effect QTLs, it may be possible tojump directly into marker-assisted selection, using the closestmarkers available in the map. However, in most cases a step offine mapping, involving a larger population and denser markerspacing in the target genomic region, is necessary fordeveloping useful [selection tools]. The ultimate result of thisapproach is the identification of the gene, and the poly-morphism in its nucleotide sequence, responsible for theobserved phenotypic differences.Journal of Agricultural and Food ChemistryReviewdx.doi.org/10.1021/jf305531j|J.  Agric.  Food  Chem.2013, 61, 8277−82868280 The QTL mapping approach is effective for explainingcontrasts between two parents, but is inefficient for exploringthe wider genetic diversity for a trait in the germplasm. Theassociation mapping approach offers a shortcut in this path andfor this reason has strong appeal to breeders.29,30In thisapproach, a panel of genetically diverse lines is denselygenotyped and carefully evaluated for a phenotypic character,with the aim of identifying associations between marker allelesand traits. Because the genealogical distance between thematerials in the panel is large, those associations will remainsignificant only if the marker is tightly linked to the causativegene or if factors related to [population genetics] (populationstructure) create associations between unlinked loci. For thelatter case, estimating population structure and taking it intoaccount explicitly in the statistical model can avoid thedetection of false associations.31When correctly applied,association analysis can result in the detection of genomicregions related to the trait of interest and, simultaneously, inthe identification of donor lines of favorable alleles from a widergermplasm.32Gene banks harbor thousands of accessions that arepotentially useful for [plant breeding]. Those accessions includewild crop relatives and obsolete landraces. Although presentingpoor agronomic value, compared to modern cultivars, thosematerials are believed to have useful genes33that have not beencaptured from wild species in the process of domestication orfrom landraces in the early phases of scientific breeding.Rescuing those useful genes that were“left behind”is a difficulttask, because the genes of interest may be tightly linked tounfavorable genes, which would be dragged along into thebreeding population. Understanding the genetic diversity ingermplasm collections is thefirst step toward better use of abroader gene pool in breeding programs. Marker-assistedbackcrossing allows identifying the rare recombinants in thevicinity of the introduced gene, trimming the chromosomesegment as close as possible to the target gene.34Additionally,by identifying individuals with the cleanest genome (with theleast residue from the donor parent), it is possible to reduce thenumber of backcrosses needed for full recovery of the elitephenotype.35Collections of chromosome segment substitution lines(CSSL libraries) are a set of lines derived from an elite variety,in which each line has one chromosome segment replaced bythe corresponding segment in the wild species of interest.11The CSSL library carries the whole genome of the wild relativesplit in bins. The phenotypic effect of the set of genes in eachbin can be evaluated against the original elite line, used as acheck. Those genetic stocks can facilitate the identification andintrogression of genes from wild relatives into elite germplasm.Superior CSSLs can be used forfine mapping and simultaneousdevelopment of an improved version of the elite variety.36Marker-Assisted Selection: Building Tailored Geno-types.Whereas in the case of  marker-assisted geneintrogression the breeder will normally tag only one gene, afull-featured marker-assisted selection scheme would monitorseveral genes simultaneously. Knowledge of the allele borne byeach plant in each major locus of interest creates the means forbuilding specific allele combinations that would maximize theagronomic value of the line. However, when one is dealing withseveral genes, it is important to keep in mind that theinteraction between genes (epistatic effect), and not only theadditive effects of the genes, defines the expression of a trait.A typical application of marker-assisted selection is resistancegene pyramiding. When one is dealing with diseases caused bypathogens presenting high variability, a single resistance genemay confer complete resistance for a few plant generations untilit is overcome by strains of the pathogen. Accumulating severalresistance genes in a variety can confer durable resistance,because the pathogen would have to beat all of the genessimultaneously, which drastically reduces the odds of resistancebreakdown.37Resistance gene pyramiding by classical breedingmethods is almost impossible, because the effect of a genecould be visible only in the absence of other resistance genes.Marker-tagged resistance genes can be easily combined withoutthe need for phenotypic screening. A similar strategy can beused for preventively breeding resistance to pathogens that arecurrently absent from a region, because in the absence of thepathogens no phenotypic screening of resistance would bepossible.Molecular markers of interest for breeders of a given speciescan be combined in optimized sets for simultaneous genotyping(“multiplexed”), allowing high-throughput application inapplied breeding programs, especially those dealing with abroader genetic base.38The implementation of such a markerset depends on a large body of previous research. For each ofthe traits of interest, several steps of research are required,normally starting with mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL),followed byfine mapping and eventually positional cloning.Once the causative gene is identified, based on a pair ofcontrasting alleles,“mining”novel alleles in diverse germplasmmay expand the range of variation of the trait or the toolbox todeal with specific stresses.39Genomic Selection: Speeding up Genetic Progress.Recent advancements in [genotyping technology] sharplyreduced the cost of genotyping, creating the possibility ofscoring thousands of markers in populations of plants underselection. The several steps of genetic analysis required toidentify the relationship of each of those markers with thephenotype could not keep pace with that. In this scenario, thebreeder can have a large amount of genotypic information withunknown relationship with the traits under selection. Thegenomic selection approach40proposes that knowledge of therelationship between specific markers and specific genes is notnecessary in the breeding context. Instead, the breeder can usethe information available for all markers in a plant to predict itsbreeding value, without effectively evaluating its phenotype,based on previous [statistical models] built for those markersusing a“training population”for which all genotypes andphenotypes have been scored. Markers are considered asrandom factors, in the framework of mixed model analysis,because the number of markers used in genomic selection isnormally superior to the number of individuals in the trainingpopulation, such that estimating the effect of each markerwould not be possible due to the lack of degrees of freedom.Simulation studies demonstrated that genomic selection canaccelerate the genetic progress of quantitative traits in[population breeding].41Genomic selection can be seen as a method to maximize thereturn from the phenotypic evaluation step in the breedingcycle.42The information drawn from one round of properphenotypic evaluation can be propagated to subsequentgenerations. Once models are built for different environments,the unique marker profile for a given individual can be used topredict its performance in each of these environments,improving considerably the inference made on each individualJournal of Agricultural and Food ChemistryReviewdx.doi.org/10.1021/jf305531j|J.  Agric.  Food  Chem.2013, 61, 8277−82868281 performance and largely reducing [evaluation costs]. Thepotential use of this approach in choosing parents of new[breeding populations] is also promising. However, thepredictability of the phenotype from the marker profile fadesout along generations, and new rounds of phenotypic data mustbe input to update the statistical model. This approach will beespecially useful in cases when phenotypic evaluation isdifficult, expensive, or conditioned to uncertain events, suchas the occurrence of a pest or specific weather condition.Genomic selection can be used to accelerate breeding foryield potential, which is frequently considered as the mostdifficult trait for marker-assisted selection. In highly competitiveseed industries, such as the cases of maize and soybean, anyincrease in the rate of genetic gain could make a significantdifference in market share. For this reason, large seedcompanies are investing heavily in high-throughput DNAanalysis and bioinformatics for seamless integration of genomicselection in breeding programs.43Seeds can be genotypedbefore planting, such that only preselected individuals will useexpensive plots in thefield. Full application of genomicselection should happen more easily in large private companies,when compared to small seed companies, public institutions,and universities, considering the amount of investment requiredfor setting and keeping up-to-date the [genotyping pipeline], theshort turnaround time for DNA analysis, data processing andselection, and the well-trained team required.■CONCLUSIONThe raw material of natural genetic diversity was carved by[human selection] during [plant domestication], resulting inprofound changes in [plant phenotypes]. Intentional or uninten-tional selection through millennia of traditional farmingresulted in a wealth of genetic diversity, adapted to differenthuman needs. However, this process worked at a speed that nolonger matches the demands of modern society. The advent ofscientific [plant breeding] accelerated the rhythm of varietalimprovement, and at this point it is difficult to predict the limitsof this approach. Molecular tools now permit monitoring thedynamics of genomic recombination, making possible a gene-by-gene breeding approach. The impact of those new methodsin farmer’sfields is just in the beginning, but the expectationsfor [plant breeding] to help meet the challenges related to foodsupply, environmental sustainability, and even fossil fuelreplacement are huge. The most modern methods will benecessary for going back to what remains from the raw materialwhere our ancestors found their sources of food, tofind thegenes that will be the building blocks of the cultivars that willsolve the problems of the 21st century.■EXAMPLES OF CHANGES IN RICE DUE TOBREEDINGRice Domestication.There are two species of cultivatedrice:Oryza sativa, originated fromOryza rufipogonin Asia, andOryza glaberrima, originated fromOryza barthiiin Africa.44TheSouth American wild speciesOryza glumaepatula, althoughsimilar toO. rufipogon, has not been domesticated (Figure 1).O. sativaaccounts for almost the entirety of global riceproduction, whereasO. glaberrimais planted only in some partsof Africa, but is being displaced by more productiveO. sativavarieties, some of them with introgressions ofO. glaberrimagenes.45The history of rice domestication is highly complexand still not completely understood.O. rufipogonis the mostwidespread and diverse of those species, which makes it themost likely source of the original domestication event.However, unlike cultivated rice, this species is perennial andpredominantly outcrossing, whereasOryza nivarais annual andself-pollinating, so it would take a lesser change to originate thecultivated type.46It is probable that both species contributedgenes for the early forms of cultivated rice.47A suite of differences are observed between wild andcultivated rice.44Wild rice presents seed dispersal mechanisms,including seed shattering, long awns, and hairy hulls. Cultivatedrice lost those characteristics, partially or completely, withnonshattering being the key trait of domestication. Seeds ofwild rice present long dormancy, which increases the odds ofperpetuation in uncertain wild environments, but is disadvanta-geous in cultivatedfields, where the farmer provides adequateconditions for germination in every growing season. Thechange in those traits may have resulted simply from harvesting,when the majority of the seeds of shattering plants were lost,and from sowing, when plants derived from nondormant seedsdominated thefield. Dark hulls and red pericarp are also typicaltraits of wild rice that have been eliminated in cultivatedmaterials, possibly by intentional [human selection] of straw-colored hulls and white pericarp.O. sativapresents two subspecies,indicaandjaponica.Itisuncertain  if  each  type  derives  from  an  independentdomestication event or if a single event later split into twosubtypes.48In favor of the independent domesticationhypothesis is the fact that the level of divergence observedbetween those two groups projects the separation before theorigin of agriculture;49furthermore, wild rice populationspresent some degree of population structure in line with thedifferences betweenindicaandjaponicarice.50Nevertheless, thefact that the mutation causing the loss of shattering in bothindicaandjaponicais the same51is strong evidence in favor of asingle domestication event. Trying to reconcile those twoconflicting pieces of evidence, Vaughan et al.52offered aninteresting explanation for the observation of similar differ-entiation in wild rice populations: the two rice types undercultivation would have frequently hybridized with wild ricepopulations, transferring part of the genetic structuring toFigure 1.American A-genome wild riceOryza glumaepatula.Abundant and wide angle tillering, open and shattering panicles, andsmall grains with awns are typical of wild rice species.Journal of Agricultural and Food ChemistryReviewdx.doi.org/10.1021/jf305531j|J.  Agric.  Food  Chem.2013, 61, 8277−82868282 [natural populations]. If this hypothesis holds true, what we seetoday in the wild would be a consequence of cultivated types, asmuch as the opposite. This implies that [plant breeding] reshapesnot only the plant under cultivation but also, to some degree,its relatives in the wild.Understanding the [domestication history] of a species isimportant to estimate the potential of wild relatives in breeding.QTL mapping studies showed thatO. rufipogoncan be used toimprove the agronomic performance ofO. sativa.53,54Under-standing the genetic relationship between germplasm acces-sions, through high-throughput marker technology, will allowdeep understanding of thousands of rice accessions in seedbanks around the world.55Rice Ideotype Breeding.Since the semidwarf rice plant,grown under higher N fertilization, brought a dramatic increasein yield in the period of the Green Revolution (1960s), ricebreeders search for other traits, or set of traits, that couldpromote another leap forward in rice productivity. Althoughthere have been yield gains, conventional breeding was moresuccessful in improving disease resistance, grain quality, andearliness than yield potential.56On the basis of simulation studies,57scientists from theInternational Rice Research Institute (IRRI) designed ahypothetical ideotype that should push the limits of rice grainyield upward. This model plant, known as the rice“new planttype”, had few tillers, but all of them bore a large panicle withmore than 200 grains on top of thick, lodge-resistant stems.Leaves were thick and erect, with intense green color.58Thosetraits, which are relatively easy to select in the breedingprogram, when combined should result in increased harvestindex and yield (Figure 2).Although based on reasonable premises, the new plant typefailed to yield more than the best varieties with the typical,modern plant type. Reduced tillering resulted in low canopybiomass, which, combined with incomplete grainfilling, offsetthe gain in harvest index on a plant basis. A second generationof new plant type lines, with larger proportion ofindicagenotype, performed better but still failed to beat the bestchecks.58China’s [national breeding] program also pursued an ideotypefor achieving unprecedented rice productivity. The Chineseideotype is similar to IRRI’s ideotype, with the main differenceof having the panicles lower in the canopy, below the height ofthe top three leaves, which should remain productive until thegrain-filling period. By adding those key traits and taking thehybrid breeding approach, the Chinese program had greatersuccess.59Hybrid breeding represented a shortcut towardconstruction of improved ideotypes, because instead of havingto introduce all of the ideotype traits into a single inbred line, itwas possible to breed two complementary parents that, whencrossed, completed the ideotype, on top of which, heterosisadded additional yield potential.60Direct Selection of Cloned Genes in Rice.With therecent advances of molecular knowledge of genes and traitcontrol, the possibility of doing [plant breeding] by pickingspecific genes and building planned combinations is graduallybecoming real. Soon it may be possible to model completemolecular ideotypes, which would be hypothesized optimalcombinations of alleles at many major genes, according to thetarget environment of the crop.With a small genome size, rich genetic diversity, and otherexperimental conveniences, rice became the model plant amongcrops. Reference genome sequencing has been completed, bothforjaponica61and forindica62types, an invaluable resource forgene cloning. Upon this body of information, rice genes arebeing cloned in laboratories around the world.63Classicalbreeding programs will benefit from the knowledge of majorgenes with significant effect on important traits. Specificprimers can be made to detect the favorable alleles, makingsure they are present in the elite lines.One of the genes of high interest to breeders isGhd7, whichsimultaneously affects grain number per panicle, plant height,and heading date.64This locus alone has a large influence onadaptation to long growing seasons, with high yield potential,or short growing seasons, with lower yield. Controlling thislocus can help to bring about the use of exotic germplasm inbreeding programs in different geographic regions.Submergence tolerance is a trait better handled molecularlythan phenotypically. As an erratic natural disaster, testing plantsforflooding tolerance in thefield is difficult and expensive.Scientists from IRRI identified a large effect QTL forfloodingtolerance (Figure 3), in which the favorable allele conferredtolerance to several days of complete submergence.65Furtherinvestigation led to the underlying gene, namedSub1A, whichplayed a role in the response of the plant to ethylene.66Marker-Figure 2.Comparison of schematic rice plants representing typicaltraditional varieties, modern semidwarf cultivars, and the proposednew plant type.

Food  Chem.2013, 61, 8277−82868283 assisted selection was used for developing submergence-tolerant versions of important rice cultivars.67Soils with low P content are common in the tropics and limitrice yield. Rice varieties differ significantly for adaptation tolow-P soils, and part of those differences is due to a major QTLon chromosome 12, namedPup1.68Several traditional uplandvarieties present the favorable allele at this locus, whereasmodern varieties appear to lack it, probably because selection isoften done in well-fertilized experimentalfields. Additionalstudies identified the underlying gene, namedPstol1, whichpromotes root growth.69Larger roots explain not only thebetter P uptake of some traditional rice varieties but also their﻿superior [drought tolerance]. Marker-assisted selection of thePup1locus will facilitate reintroducing the favorable allele intomodern cultivars, without yield penalty
