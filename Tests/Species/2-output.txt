WithinOryza sativa, there is an ancient and well-established divergence between thetwo major subspecies,indicaandjaponica, but finer levels of genetic structure are suggested by the breedinghistory.  In  this  study,  a  sample  of  234  accessions  of  rice  was  genotyped  at  169  nuclear  SSRs  and  twochloroplast loci. The data were analyzed to resolve the genetic structure and to interpret the evolutionaryrelationships between groups. Five distinct groups were detected, corresponding toindica,aus,aromatic,temperate japonica, andtropical japonicarices. Nuclear and chloroplast data support a closer evolutionaryrelationship between theindicaand theausand among thetropical japonica,temperate japonica, andaromaticgroups. Group differences can be explained through contrasting demographic histories. With the availabil-ity of rice genome sequence, coupled with a large collection of publicly available genetic resources, it isof interest to develop a population-based framework for the molecular analysis of diversity inO. sativa.ASIANcultivated rice (Oryza sativaL.) holds a uniquegroups of rice are expected to show greater genetic differ-position among domesticated crop species in thatentiation than would be the case in an outcrossing species.it  is  both  a  critical  food  staple  and  the  first  fully  se-Because of fewer opportunities for cross-pollination, thequenced  crop  genome.

To utilize analysis approaches that arebased  on  the  stepwise  mutation  model  (SMM),  a  set  of  60SSR loci that behaved in a stepwise manner (10% of alleleswere at nonstepwise intervals) was identified (as indicated inthe list of SSRs published in supplemental Table S2 at http://www.genetics.org/supplemental/).  This  set  of  loci  was  usedfor  analysis  of  directional  evolution  and  population  bottle-necks.

Thetem-perate japonicaandaromaticpopulations  also  had  thehighest  incidence  of  monomorphism,  with  15  and  21monomorphic  loci,  respectively.  Interestingly,  the  al-leles at all 15 monomorphic loci in thetemperate japonicagroup were identical in size to the most frequent alleleamong thetropical japonica. This observation is consis-tent with the hypothesis thattemperate japonicarices werederived fromtropical japonica. For 15 of the 21 monomor-phic loci in thearomaticsample, the allele was identicalin size to the most frequent allele in thetropical japonica,and this was often the most frequent or only allele inthetemperate japonica.Directional evolution in allele length:It has been pro-posed  that  there  is  an  upward  bias  in  the  number  ofrepeats responsible for the hypervariability of SSRs thatwould  lead  to  larger  average  allele  sizes  in  “derived”groups (Rubinszteinet al.1995). This has been shownto be true in the comparison of humans and nonhumanprimates (Rubinszteinet al.1995) and in nonancestralpopulations  of  maize  (Vigourouxet al.2003).  Usingthe framework established by the population structureanalysis, comparisons of allele lengths between groupsusing the subset of 60 SSR loci that have evolved in astepwise fashion resulted in statistically significant differ-ences among some populations of rice (Table 3). Theaverage  standardized  allele  lengths  in  theindica,aus,andaromaticgroups were significantly smaller than thosein thetemperateandtropical japonicagroups although theallele  lengths  in  theindica,aus,  andaromaticgroupswere not statistically different from each other. Further-more, in the comparison betweentemperateandtropicaljaponica, the average standardized allele size is greaterin  the former  (t9.31,P0.0001), supporting  thehypothesis  that  thetemperate japonicagroup  is  derivedfrom thetropical japonicagroup.Population bottlenecks:The observed differences indiversity among the rice populations suggest differencesin demographic history that have shaped these patterns.Figure2.—Model-based  ancestry  for  each  accession.
