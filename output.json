{ "text": "The order Coelacanthiformes, once thought extinct, is much studied mainly because it contains speciesthat share characteristics with lungfishes and tetrapods. Only a few years ago living specimens werediscovered to science, and observations are so rare that the species are considered to be critically endangered.Observations include Latimeria chalumnae in deep waters of the coast of south eastern Africawhile Latimeria menadoensis is known from similar habitats in Indonesian waters. Because of the interestaround these enigmatic species, Ecological Niche Modelling techniques have been applied to estimatetheir distribution. The underlying assumption is that the environmental characteristics of the observationpoints are representative for the species. In this article we evaluate the difference in the output betweenthe niche distributions produced by two expert systems and by two models based on Artificial NeuralNetworks. We evaluate the predictive behaviour of such models by focusing on L. chalumnae, as moreobservations are available for this species with respect to L. menadoensis. Finally, we assess the reliabilityof the maps by numerically evaluating the representativeness of the environmental characteristics inthe observation locations, with respect to an area where the models show significant differences. Thisapproach is different from previous ones because one of the expert systems is used to infer pseudoabsencepoints, that are successively employed to feed a Neural Network. One of the models based onthis Neural Network is used to estimate the potential distribution and to produce a more extended map.The method promises to be applicable to other species with few observations, and allows to exploit thepower of presence\absence based techniques.", "entities": [{"indices": [334,353]},{"indices": [413,434]},{"indices": [757,764]},{"indices": [999,1011]},{"indices": [1078,1092]},{"indices": [1271,1278]},]}
