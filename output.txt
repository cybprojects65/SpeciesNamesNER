Table 2.4 presents the number of plants per detailed growth stage per treatment per species and Table 2.5 presents the average height of emerged plants at the time of harrowing. These tables show that [plant size] differences between treatments of a species could not be avoided. However, these differences have been partially accounted for by the [statistical analysis] of chapters 3-6. Experimental design and [statistical analysis]  As the experimental procedure was quite laborious, the experimental design should be very efficient to be practical. Therefore, a reduced central composite design was used to examine the effects of working depth, working speed and [soil moisture] content in L. perenne and L. sativum experiments (Table 2.3; Fig. 2.11).  To be able to adjust the harrow optimally and to choose weed control strategies, farmers need to be able to predict the efficacy of harrowing from the condition of the weeds immediately after the harrowing. However, few studies have examined the relationship between the initial and final effects as influenced by soil and weather conditions. Studies revealing that crop yield losses are correlated to crop covering (Rasmussen, 1991b; Rydberg, 1993; Rasmussen & Svenningsen, 1995) generally apply to established cereal crops. In our study, we found that the reduction in the fresh weight of the total L. perenne and L. sativum population was closely related to covering. Although fresh [weight reduction] of the total L. sativum population correlated better with the percentage of plants uprooted, the percentage of plants covered was a useful predictor because the uprooting and covering of seedlings by harrowing were interrelated (Kurstjens et al., 2000). For control of weeds at emergence, the percentage of plants covered was not a useful predictor because, although nearly all the white threads were covered, only uprooting resulted in mortality or in [growth reduction]. Although burying might be more effective under conditions other than those in our experiments, the fact that many covered plants were also uprooted suggests that uprooting primarily caused the effectiveness of covering.
