Tilapia is one of the most popular aquaculture species and is farmed in more than 120 countries and territories. A bioeconomic model on tilapia [pond culture] has been developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) based on experiences in China, the largest tilapia farming country. The results of the model indicate that the technical and economic performance of tilapia farming can be significantly improved by optimal selection of stocking timing, fingerling size, [stocking density], growing period (or crop length), harvest timing and harvest size according to technical, economic and climate factors. Bioeconomic modelling can facilitate knowledge-based innovations for increasing technical and [economic benefits] [pond culture] through more [chemical analysis methods] efficient use of resources. Its potential has yet to be adequately appreciated or utilized. This paper represents an effort to improve the situation.
